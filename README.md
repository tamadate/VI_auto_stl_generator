# VI_auto_stl_generator
## 1. Introduction
This is a stl file generator for virtual impactor CFD simulation with OpenFOAM.  The code automatically generate a CAD drawing by running a script "virtual_impactor.FCMacro" from FreeCAD based on the design parameters set in the file, e.g., nozzle width, nozzle-to-recieving tube distance, and so on (21 parameters are avairable in current version).

## 2. Installation
We assume you are working with Linux.
### 2.1 Install FreeCAD
This code requires the relatively new version of FreeCAD (see [LINK](https://wiki.freecad.org/Installing_on_Linux)).  When you use the apt install command, it may install older version but we checked this code does not works with the versions FreeCAD 0.18.x.  We recommend to install newer version than FreeCAD 0.20.1.
